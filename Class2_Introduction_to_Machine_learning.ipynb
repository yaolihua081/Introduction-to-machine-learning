However, this information is not available—that is, we do not know whether each potential customer is a big spender or not. In this setting, we can try to cluster the customers on the basis of the variables measured, in order to identify distinct groups of potential customers. Identifying such groups can be of interest because it might be that the groups differ with respect to some property of interest, such as spending habits.\n","\n","Semi-supervised learning problem: there are some m observations with response Y, but there are n-m observations that have no response value; mnay times the collection of Y is expensive or difficult.\n","\n","We will have applications for both supervised and unsupervised."],"metadata":{"id":"lKpr177m-WQa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.4 Output data\n","**bold text**\n"," Classification(image recognitation, disease, pass/fail, YES/No), Prediction(stock price, students attribute estimates, sale price)"],"metadata":{"id":"LElg7dRWBq4S"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.**Statistics**"],"metadata":{"id":"3keW8omWU3zf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2.1 **Dependent Variable and Independent Variables.**\n","\n","Let Y, a dependent variable, be an observed quantitative variable. $X = (X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{p})$ where $X_{1}, X_{2}, . . . , X_{p}$ are p independent variables.
